# 1.052J Advancing Mechanics and Materials via Machine Learning

## Forward Problem
The code for the forward problem can be found in `Architecture1and2_AuxeticsProblem_FinalCode.ipynb`. Within the notebook is code for both the traditional regression model and for our symbolic regression model.

The dataset used across the forward and inverse problems is `auxeticsdataset.csv`, adopted from [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3wxyzfyvh6/1) for original use in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2238785423012851)

## Inverse Problem 
The images generated for solving the inverse problem are in the `images` directory, while the code is under `Architecture3_AuxeticsInverseProblem.ipynb`, and example output equations from the symbolic regression model's training can be found in `outputs`.

## Project Report
The final report for this project is under `1052_Auxetics_Project_Report.pdf`
